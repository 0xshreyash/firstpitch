    "thanks": `Thank you so much for trying our application,
    since I was in high school I was fascinated by perfect pitch.
    I wasn't born with it, but I had people around me who could identify notes instantly.
    I desperately tried to learn it and went through a whole bunch of iOS/Android apps that claimed to teach it.
    However, I didn't find one that worked and had the exact features I was looking for.
    I set out to build it myself with the support of my friend Shreyash.
    Our goal is to see everybody no matter the age or experience in music, learn the power of perfect pitch.
